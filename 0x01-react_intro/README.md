React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily developed and maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. Hereâ€™s an introduction to the key concepts and features of React:

Key Concepts
Components:

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently.
There are two main types of components: functional components and class components. Functional components are written as JavaScript functions, while class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
JSX:

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. JSX makes the code easier to understand and write.
