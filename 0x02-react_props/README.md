In React, "props" (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another. Props are a core concept in React that enable component reusability and the ability to build dynamic, data-driven applications. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at React props:

Key Features of Props

Read-Only: Props are immutable. Once a prop is passed to a component, it cannot be changed by that component. This ensures that components remain pure and predictable.

Data Flow: Props enable a unidirectional data flow, meaning data is passed from parent to child components. This helps in maintaining a clear and manageable data flow in the application.

Reusable Components: Props allow components to be reusable by passing different data to the same component. This makes it easy to create flexible and modular UI components.
